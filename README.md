# Analytical Modelling Of Human Population
## Abstract
In this project we have tried to learn about human population modelling and how different factors affect the population growth. We have especially concentrated on exponential modelling of the human population model and used it to predict the future population of three different countries taken entirely from different economical background.To predict the future population we have made use of Euler and RK4 method. We have selected taken India from developing nations, USA from developed nation and Madagascar from under developed category. We have also studied the fertility growth rate of this three different countries, for this purpose we used polynomial regression.

This project is part of a submission for the course PHY 312: Numerical Methods, IISER Bhopal,
Fall 2021.
